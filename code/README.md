Code

This directory contains the exploratory code for the analysis. This directory contains two files: 
* eda-script.R which creates eda-output.txt and creates the images of histograms. This code is used to explore the variables to be used in the linear regression to see if they are good candidates for a linear model. 
* regression-script.R which produces the regression analysis and also exports an image of the scatterplot of the two variables.
