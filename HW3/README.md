Title: Multilinear Regression Analysis

Author: Bryana Gutierrez


The goal of this anaylsis is to explore multiple linear regression for Stat 159 a course on reproducible research. 

This project contains four main directories: data, code, images, and report. Data contains the data used in the analysis. Code contains the code files that take that data and do the analysis. Images contains any images produced by the analysis. Finally, report contains the process and findings of the analysis.

How to recreate this project. Using the command make you would want to use make data to load the data into the data folder. With the appropriate scripts in the code/scripts, the functions in code/functions, and the Rmd file of the written report, then you can run make by itself. Make will run the scripts that do exploratory data analysis and create images. It will also compile the Rmd into PDF and html. To test that the functions are running well, use make tests. To remove the pdf and html of the report, use make clean.
